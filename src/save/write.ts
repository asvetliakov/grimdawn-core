/**
 * Writing a character save back to disk — the only place in this tool that does.
 *
 * Two rules, both learned from what the rest of the app already knows about
 * this file. The game writes saves event-driven and non-atomically, and the
 * watcher is live: a partial write would be read as a torn save, retried, and
 * then fall back to a rotation backup, so the window would show the character
 * as they were *before* the edit. Hence temp file plus `rename`, the pattern
 * `db/cache.ts` and `advice-store.ts` already use, with an `fsync` added
 * because this one is the user's character rather than a cache.
 *
 * And the original is kept forever. The doctrine the advice store follows —
 * nothing in this app deletes something that cost the user anything — applies
 * far more here: the game itself cannot undo a mastery removal.
